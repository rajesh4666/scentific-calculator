HTML Structure: 
The calculator has an input field for displaying the calculations and buttons for operations. Each button calls a JavaScript function when clicked.

CSS Styling: 
Basic styling is applied to make the calculator look cleaner and more user-friendly.

JavaScript Functions:
clearDisplay(): Clears the display field.
deleteLast(): Removes the last character from the display.
append(value): Adds a character or operator to the display. Handles special cases like the first character being '0'.
calculate(): Evaluates the expression in the display using "eval()". It also replaces the "^" operator with "**" for exponentiation, which JavaScript understands.
This code provides a simple scientific calculator with the ability to handle basic operations, trigonometric functions, logarithms, square roots, and factorials. For a more robust solution, especially for complex mathematical operations, you might want to use libraries like Math.js for evaluation and more advanced features.
